##### Professionel Experience

Hi, I am Sidra Kazmi. I am a certified Life Coach, NLP Practitioner-Trainer, and a Child and Youth Counselor for the last ten years. 

I have a Bachelor's in Psychology from Brock University, one of Canada's distinguished universities. My post-grad diploma as a Child and Youth Counselor equipped me to help children and youth overcome their mental and developmental issues. I got my certification and training from Transform Destiny, California, USA. 

No matter which hat I wear, my goal is simple - empowering my clients and making them take control of their lives. The services that I provide are not just limited to NLP; I combine my psychology background and counseling expertise in all my therapy sessions. From the past ten years, I have been helping people from all different age groups and backgrounds. The amazing transformations that I see in my clients make my life worthwhile. 

I am also a co-author of a book called Quick Fix: Recipe for Bliss.
