                    <p><p>Hi there. Welcome to the amazing world of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, also referred as NLP in short.</p>
<p>NLP is based on a variety of techniques, such as Hypnotherapy, Emotional Freedom Technique, TIME technique, to name a few. These methods are used for emotional, psychological, and personal development. There is a strong connection between the human mind, language, and behavior. Just some small changes in these three aspects of your personality can make a huge difference. The outcome that you will get after making these changes will not only help you achieve your goals but change your life and your future for better.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Sidra Kazmi. I am a certified Life Coach, NLP Practitioner-Trainer, and a Child and Youth Counselor for the last ten years.</p>
<p>I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Psychology from Brock University, one of Canada&rsquo;s distinguished universities. My post-grad diploma as a Child and Youth Counselor equipped me to help children and youth overcome their mental and developmental issues. I got my certification and training from Transform Destiny, California, USA.</p>
<p>No matter which hat I wear, my goal is simple - empowering my clients and making them take control of their lives. The services that I provide are not just limited to NLP; I combine my psychology background and counseling expertise in all my therapy sessions. From the past ten years, I have been helping people from all different age groups and backgrounds. The amazing transformations that I see in my clients make my life worthwhile.</p>
<p>I am also a co-author of a book called Quick Fix: Recipe for Bliss.</p>
